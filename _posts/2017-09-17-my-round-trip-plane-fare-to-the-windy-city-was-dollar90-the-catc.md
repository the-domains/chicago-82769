  My round trip plane fare to the windy city was $90. The catch is that you
  don’t get a “carry on” you get one “personal item”. In my case that will be
  the very backpack appearing in Shelby’s Vacation at the Reeling film festival
  which as it happens fits the dimentions of a “personal item” according to the
  airlines.
